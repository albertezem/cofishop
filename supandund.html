        <h2>What are "textual evidence" questions?</h2>
        <p>On the Reading and Writing section of your SAT, some questions will introduce a claim about an unfamiliar subject. The question will then ask you to identify the piece of evidence that <strong>most strongly supports</strong> that claim.</p>
        <p>Textual evidence questions will look like this:</p>

        <h2>TEXTUAL EVIDENCE: EXAMPLE</h2>
        <p>Jan Gimsa, Robert Sleigh, and Ulrike Gimsa have hypothesized that the sail-like structure running down the back of the dinosaur Spinosaurus aegyptiacus improved the animal’s success in underwater pursuits of prey species capable of making quick, evasive movements. To evaluate their hypothesis, a second team of researchers constructed two battery-powered mechanical models of S. aegyptiacus, one with a sail and one without, and subjected the models to a series of identical tests in a water-filled tank.</p>

        <p><strong>Which finding from the model tests, if true, would most strongly support Gimsa and colleagues’ hypothesis?</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>(Choice A) The model with a sail took significantly longer to travel a specified distance while submerged than the model without a sail did.</li>
            <li>(Choice B) The model with a sail displaced significantly more water while submerged than the model without a sail did.</li>
            <li>(Choice C) The model with a sail had significantly less battery power remaining after completing the tests than the model without a sail did.</li>
            <li>(Choice D) The model with a sail took significantly less time to complete a sharp turn while submerged than the model without a sail did.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Explanation:</h2>
        <p>First, we need to focus on the hypothesis our evidence needs to support: "the sail-like structure running down the back of the dinosaur Spinosaurus aegyptiacus improved the animal’s success in underwater pursuits of prey species capable of making quick, evasive movements".</p>
        <p>We can simplify this hypothesis: Sail on back = quicker movements. Which choice strengthens this idea?</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Choice A:</strong> Incorrect — sail on back = slower movement, which is opposite of the desired support.</li>
            <li><strong>Choice B:</strong> Incorrect — focuses on water displacement, not speed of movement.</li>
            <li><strong>Choice C:</strong> Incorrect — focuses on power, not speed of movement.</li>
            <li><strong>Choice D:</strong> Correct — sail on back = quicker movements (supports the hypothesis).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How should we think about textual evidence questions?</h2>
        <p>There are two types of textual evidence questions, and we need to think about each type a little differently:</p>

        <h2>Scientific evidence</h2>
        <p>These questions present a hypothesis about a scientific subject, usually in the context of new research or experimentation. The task is to interpret the researchers' hypothesis and identify the research outcome that would support that hypothesis.</p>

        <h2>Literary evidence</h2>
        <p>In literary evidence questions, the passage makes an argument about a literary work. Your job is to evaluate whether each quotation serves as evidence for the argument in question.</p>

        <h2>How to approach textual evidence questions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Step 1: Identify the argument</strong> — Find the central argument in the text.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 2: Create a test phrase</strong> — Simplify the argument in your own words.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 3: Test the choices</strong> — Compare each choice to the test phrase and select the best match.</li>
        </ol>
