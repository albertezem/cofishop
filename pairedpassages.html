    <div class="content">
        <h2>What are "Cross-text Connections" questions?</h2>
        <p>On the Reading and Writing section of your SAT, some questions will present two short texts for you to read. The question will then ask you to <span class="important">compare the points of view</span> of the authors of the two texts.</p>

        <p>Cross-text connections questions will look like this:</p>
        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Text 1:</strong> What factors influence the abundance of species in a given ecological community? Some theorists have argued that historical diversity is a major driver of how diverse an ecological community eventually becomes: differences in community diversity across otherwise similar habitats, in this view, are strongly affected by the number of species living in those habitats at earlier times.</p>
            <p><strong>Text 2:</strong> In 2010, a group of researchers including biologist Carla Cáceres created artificial pools in a New York forest. They stocked some pools with a diverse mix of zooplankton species and others with a single zooplankton species. Over four years, they measured the species diversity and found that by the end of the study, there was little to no difference in species diversity among the pools.</p>

            <p><strong>Question:</strong> Based on the texts, how would Cáceres and colleagues (Text 2) most likely describe the view of the theorists presented in Text 1?</p>

            <div class="choice"><strong>Choice A:</strong> It is largely correct, but it requires a minor refinement in light of the research team’s results.</div>
            <div class="choice"><strong>Choice B:</strong> It is not compelling as a theory regardless of any experimental data collected by the research team.</div>
            <div class="choice"><strong>Choice C:</strong> It may seem plausible, but it is not supported by the research team’s findings.</div>
            <div class="choice"><strong>Choice D:</strong> It probably holds true only in conditions like those in the research team’s study.</div>
        </div>

        <h2>Explanation:</h2>
        <p>Let’s start by summarizing each text:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Text 1:</strong> This passage presents the view of theorists, claiming that historical diversity is a major factor in determining how diverse a community becomes.</li>
            <li><strong>Text 2:</strong> This passage presents an experiment where scientists found that early diversity had no impact on later diversity.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Now that we have summarized, we see that the two texts <span class="important">disagree</span>. The theory from Text 1 is not supported by the findings in Text 2.</p>

        <h2>Check the choices:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Choice D:</strong> This suggests that the theory "holds true," but we found the opposite, so we eliminate this choice.</li>
            <li><strong>Choice B:</strong> This goes beyond what is stated, suggesting the scientists didn’t believe the theory before the experiment. We eliminate this choice.</li>
            <li><strong>Choice A:</strong> This says the scientists think the theory is "largely correct," but they do not support the theory in their findings. Eliminate.</li>
            <li><strong>Choice C:</strong> This identifies that while the theory sounds plausible, it is not supported by the findings. This is the correct answer.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How should we approach cross-text connections questions?</h2>
        <p>Cross-text connections questions require us to examine two passages that cover the same subject but may express different points of view.</p>

        <h3>Step 1: Summarize the texts</h3>
        <p>Read both texts and boil them down to simple summaries. Focus on the <span class="important">point of view</span> expressed in each text. In the example above, Text 1 presents a theory, and Text 2 presents research that contradicts it.</p>

        <h3>Step 2: Determine the relationship</h3>
        <p>After summarizing, determine how the points of view relate to one another:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Do the points of view <span class="important">agree</span> or <span class="important">disagree</span>?</li>
            <li>Does one passage <span class="important">elaborate</span> on or <span class="important">modify</span> the other?</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Step 3: Test the choices</h3>
        <p>Compare your summary to the answer choices. Eliminate choices that don’t match the relationship between the texts or go beyond what the texts state.</p>
        <p>The correct answer will be <span class="important">directly supported</span> by the text.</p>
    </div>
