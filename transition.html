            <h2>The Basics</h2>
            <p>On the Reading and Writing section of your SAT, some questions will ask you to  select the most logical transition word or phrase to connect information and ideas  within a brief passage . </p>

            <h2>How do we go around this?</h2>


<p>Transitions are the glue that holds ideas together. They connect sentences in ways  that tell the reader how those sentences are related. Is there an argument being made?  A story being told? The transitions used in the text should reflect that relationship. The relationships between ideas usually fall into the following categories: Agreement or disagreement </p>
<h2>Do the sentences express the same underlying idea? If so, we may want to use  an agreement transition like "similarly". </h2>
<p>Lentils are an excellent way to add plant-based protein to one's diet. Similarly, other  legumes, like beans and chickpeas, can serve as integral protein sources for vegans  and vegetarians. </p>
<p>Other common agreement transitions include again, also, correspondingly,  equally, and likewise. </p>
<h2>Do the sentences identify a disagreement or contrast? If so, we may want to use  a disagreement transition like "however". </h2>
<p>The rock star Prince was a multi-instrumentalist, having played 27 instruments on  his debut album. However, he is primarily remembered as a guitarist and vocalist. <p>
<p>Other common disagreement transitions include but, yet, conversely, though, still,  in contrast, although, nevertheless, and on the other hand.</h2> 

<h2>Are the events in the sentences being organized by time or by position? If so, we  may want to use a sequence transition like "previously".</h2>
<p>The Pulitzer Prize-winning novel A Confederacy of Dunces was published in 1980,  seventeen years after it was written. Previously, the novel had been rejected by  many different publishers. </p>
<p>Other common sequence transitions include then, later, before, first,  finally, and subsequently. </p>

<h2>Does the second sentence elaborate on the first? If so, we may want to use  an addition transition like "furthermore" </h2>
<p>Moles are highly suited to their lifestyle, with short, powerful forelimbs adapted for  digging. Furthermore, moles have evolved to require less oxygen, allowing them  to avoid suffocation while underground. </p>
<p>Other common addition transitions include additionally, also, too,  moreover. </p>
<h2>Does the second sentence provide an example? If so, we may want to use  an exemplification transition like "for instance". </h2>
<p>Throughout history, painters were endangered by poisonous ingredients in their  paints. The use of lead in white paint, for instance, caused lead poisoning in many  famous artists, including Vincent Van Gogh. </p>
<p>Other common exemplification transitions include for example, for one  thing, and to demonstrate. </p>

<h2>Is the second sentence caused by or a consequence of the idea in the first sentence?  If so, we may want to use a cause and effect transition like "therefore". </h2>
<p>The Hubble Space Telescope has provided astronomical insights for over 30 years,  but its eventual breakdown is inevitable. Therefore, its successor, the James Webb  Space Telescope, was launched in late 2021. </p>

            <h2>Some steps</h2>
<h3>Step 1: Summarize the text in your own words </h3>
<p>Don't just skim the passage . Read it closely, and try to summarize the main idea in  your own words. This can be tricky since an important transition word is missing. If  you're struggling to understand the text, try to translate each sentence into a simple bullet point. </p>
<h3>Step 2: Identify the relationship between the passageâ€™s ideas </h3>
<p>The transition we're asked to select will connect two ideas from the passage. How  are those ideas related? Do they disagree? Does one cause the other? We should be  able to place the relationship into one of the four categories discussed above. </p>
<h3>Step 3: Select the transition that matches the relationship </h3>
<p>Only one of the choices will offer a transition that matches the relationship we  identified. We can select it with confidence! 
If you find yourself stuck between two choices, try plugging them each into the  blank. Which transition creates the clearest meaning when placed in context? </p>
