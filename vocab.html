            <h2>The Basics</h2>
            <p>The first rule of SAT Vocabulary is that you do not need to memorize super jumbo dictionaries to be prepared.</p>
            
               
<p>What you do need though, is these four steps : </p>

<p>One : Read the context of the sentences before the word is requried.</p>

    <p>Two : Think of what word could replace it before even glancing at the options. When you see the options, your brain naturally conditions you to think one is correct, which can be dangerous. </p>

<p> Three : Look at the options and remove any words you know are incorrect. (Atleast one option, even in hard questions, is obviously incorrect)</p>
<p>Four : Eliminate any extremely (And i mean EXTREMELY) bogus, unrecognizable word. Essentially any word you wouldnt use in atleast High School English passages or answers. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="lesson">
            <h2>Example</h2>
            <p>Lets take an example. </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Particle physicists like Ayana Holloway Arce and
                Aida El-Khadra spend much of their time _______
                what is invisible to the naked eye: using sophisticated
                technology, they closely examine the behavior of
                subatomic particles, the smallest detectable parts of
                matter.</p>
                <p></p>
                Which choice completes the text with the most
                logical and precise word or phrase? 
                </p>
                <p>A) Selecting </p>
<p>B) Inspecting </p>
<p>C) Creating</p>
<p>D) Deciding </p>

<p> This isn't a really hard question. Anyone reading this should have probably gotten the answer by now, but we’ll still go over it. </p>

<p> Lets start with rule 1 : What comes before the sentence is practically useless and doesn’t give any substantial information. </p>

<p>What comes AFTER though, is very essential. We see keywords such as examine and can infer what word would fit in perfectly.</p>

<p>Rule 2 : Think of the word that could replace it, without looking at the options </p>

<p>Rule 3 : Eliminate all incorrect words. Deciding  doesn't fit into this context. Selecting can be misleading, but the part of the passage after the blank word doesn't actually suggest them selecting anything or doing anything with their selection. Creating also is incorrect for this reason.</p>

<p> We are left with inspecting, which perfectly correlates with the second part of the passage</p>


<h2>Whether the reign of a French monarch such as Hugh Capet or Henry I was historically consequential or relatively uneventful, its trajectory was shaped by questions of legitimacy and therefore cannot be understood without a corollary understanding of the factors that allowed the monarch to _______ his right to hold the throne. </h2>


<p>Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?</p>


<p> A) reciprocate </p>
<p> B) annotate </p>
<p> C) buttress </p>
<p>D) disengage </p>


<p> This is much more complex. Not because of the options, but because this passage makes any reader's head steam. </p>

<p> Apply rule 1 : What comes before the required word.</p>
<p> We can see the sentences before the required word talk about the reign of French Monarchs. I don't understand the word corollary, an example of big English you should probably invest in ignoring. From reading the passage we can infer the main idea, heavily simplifying it.</p>

<p> One : The French monarch's reign is clouded by questions of legitimacy. </p>
<p> Two : These questions cannot be answered until we know how the monarchs __ their right to the throne. </p>

<p> Rule 2 Application : Think of what can enter without looking at the options. For me, I actually can’t think of anything, which is okay. For questions like these you’d have to skip to rule 3. </p>


<p> Rule 3 : Remove any bogus words or options. We can see that annotate is a bit of a word most of us wouldn't know, and if you DO know it, you’ll know it can't fit in at all.

<p> reciprocate?? Reciprocate is a bit odd here. Reciprocate with who?? Let's hold on with that for now.</p>

<p> Disengage completely goes against the beginning part of the sentence that talks about their REIGN. </p>

<p> Buttress means support. Perfect fit, and puts disengage to shame.</p>
