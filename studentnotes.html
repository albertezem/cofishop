        <h2>What are "Rhetorical Synthesis" questions?</h2>
        <p>On the Reading and Writing section of your SAT, some questions will provide you with a series of bulleted notes that contain related information about an unfamiliar topic. The question will then ask you to effectively use relevant information from the notes to accomplish a particular goal.</p>

        <p>Rhetorical synthesis questions will look like this:</p>
        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Maika’i Tubbs is a Native Hawaiian sculptor and installation artist.</li>
                <li>His work has been shown in the United States, Canada, Japan, and Germany, among other places.</li>
                <li>Many of his sculptures feature discarded objects.</li>
                <li>His work <em>Erasure</em> (2008) includes discarded audiocassette tapes and magnets.</li>
                <li>His work <em>Home Grown</em> (2009) includes discarded pushpins, plastic plates and forks, and wood.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The student wants to emphasize a similarity between the two works. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?</p>

            <div class="choice"><strong>Choice A:</strong> <em>Erasure</em> (2008) uses discarded objects such as audiocassette tapes and magnets; <em>Home Grown</em> (2009), however, includes pushpins, plastic plates and forks, and wood.</div>
            <div class="choice"><strong>Choice B:</strong> Like many of Tubbs’s sculptures, both <em>Erasure</em> and <em>Home Grown</em> include discarded objects: <em>Erasure</em> uses audiocassette tapes, and <em>Home Grown</em> uses plastic forks.</div>
            <div class="choice"><strong>Choice C:</strong> Tubbs’s work, which often features discarded objects, has been shown both within the United States and abroad.</div>
            <div class="choice"><strong>Choice D:</strong> Tubbs completed <em>Erasure</em> in 2008 and <em>Home Grown</em> in 2009.</div>
        </div>

        <h2>Check:</h2>
        <p>For rhetorical synthesis questions, we really want to focus on the goal identified in the question stem. In this case, that goal is to <span class="important">"emphasize a similarity between the two works."</span></p>

        <p>Let’s look through the choices:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Choice A:</strong> This choice emphasizes a <strong>difference</strong> between the two works, focusing on how they use different objects.</li>
            <li><strong>Choice B:</strong> This choice highlights a <strong>similarity</strong>, pointing out that both works include discarded objects. This is the correct answer.</li>
            <li><strong>Choice C:</strong> This choice doesn’t mention either of the works directly and fails to emphasize a similarity.</li>
            <li><strong>Choice D:</strong> This choice gives information about when the works were completed, which introduces a difference rather than a similarity.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How should we approach rhetorical synthesis questions?</h2>
        <p>Rhetorical synthesis questions provide a lot of information. To avoid getting overwhelmed, we should first focus on the <span class="important">goal</span> in the question prompt.</p>

        <p>Follow these steps to succeed:</p>
        <h3>Step 1: Identify the goal</h3>
        <p>Start by reading the question prompt. What does the correct answer need to accomplish? If you are confused, you can refer to the bulleted notes for context, but the goal will usually be plainly stated.</p>

        <h3>Step 2: Test the choices</h3>
        <p>Read through the answer choices. Ask yourself, "Does this choice accomplish the goal?" If not, eliminate it.</p>

        <h3>Step 3: Select the correct answer</h3>
        <p>Finally, choose the option that best matches the goal stated in the question prompt. In our example, <span class="important">Choice B</span> emphasized the similarity between the two works, which was the goal of the question.</p>
