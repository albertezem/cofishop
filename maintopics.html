            <h2>The Basics</h2>
           <p>What are "central ideas and details" questions? </p>
<p>On the Reading and Writing section of your SAT, some questions will present a  short passage for you to read. The passage may be excerpted from a work of  literature or from a scholarly essay. </p>
<p>Once you read the passage, you'll be asked either to identify the main idea of the  text or to answer a specific question based on the text. 
Central ideas and details questions will look like this: </p>

        <p>Central ideas questions ask us to identify "the main idea" of the passage. Since the  passages for these questions are fairly short, finding this main idea shouldn't be too  tricky. <p>
<p><b>The main idea should </b><p>
<p2>cover a majority of the details introduced in the text. </p>
<p>∙ mention any particular points of emphasis from the text. </P>
<p><b>The main idea should not </b></p>
<p>∙ focus too intently on just one detail from the text. <p>
<p>∙ introduce new ideas not addressed within the text. </p>
<p>∙ contradict information from the text.<p>

<p>Details </p>
<p>Details questions ask us to answer a specific question about an idea contained in the  passage. Details questions can usually be answered using information from one  particular sentence in the text. 
These questions will contain words, phrases, or ideas that direct us to the appropriate  part of the text. Once there, we simply need to find the correct detail needed to  answer the question.

<h2>How to answer central ideas and details questions </h2>
<h3>To solve a central ideas and details question, consider following these </h3>

<h4>steps:</h4>

<h5> Step 1: Summarize the text in your own words </h5>
<p>Don't just skim the passage. Read it closely, and try to summarize the ideas you  encounter in your own words. By the time you finish reading, you should have a  strong understanding of the information contained in the passage. </p>
<h5>Step 2: Determine the task </h5>
<p>The question that follows the passage will reveal your task. Does it ask about the  "main idea"? Or does it ask about a particular piece of information? </p>
<h5>Step 3: Revisit the text </h5>
<p>If the question is about the main idea, then revisit your summary of the text to find  the overarching theme. 
If the question asks about something specific, then head to that section of the passage  to search out the correct detail. </p>
<h5>Step 4: Predict and eliminate </h5>
<p>Based on your understanding of the passage, you should be able to answer to the  question fairly accurately without even looking at the choices. If someone asked you  to summarize the text, what would you say? 
For instance, in the example question above, we might predict that the main idea is  something like 
"Ashley D. Farmer has improved the study of the Black Power movement by  exploring the roles of women." 
Once you predict the answer in your own words, it should be pretty easy to find a  match among the choices. If you're still not sure, you can eliminate your way to the  answer by getting rid of choices that contradict the passage or introduce new ideas. </p>

<h2> Example <h2>
<p>Many intellectual histories of the Black Power movement of the 1960s and 1970s  rely heavily on essays and other explicitly ideological works as primary sources, a  tendency that can overrepresent the perspectives of a small number of thinkers, most  of whom were male. Historian Ashley D. Farmer has shown that expanding the array  of primary sources to encompass more types of print material—including political  cartoons, advertisements, and artwork—leads to a much better understanding of the  movement and the crucial and diverse roles that Black women played in shaping it. </p>
<p>Which choice best describes the main idea of the text? <p>

<p>A-Before Farmer’s research, historians had largely ignored the intellectual dimensions  of the Black Power movement. </p>

<p>B-Farmer’s methods and research have enriched the historical understanding of the  Black Power movement and Black women’s contributions to it. </p>

<p>C-Other historians of the Black Power movement have criticized Farmer’s use of  unconventional primary sources. </p>

<p>D-The figures in the Black Power movement whom historians tend to cite would have  agreed with Farmer’s conclusions about women’s roles in the movement. </p>

<p>Explanation: 
This question asks about a detail from the text. 
Specifically, the question references Bill ""asking about seafaring men". Let's use  that phrase as a guide and find it in the passage: 
Every day when [Bill] came back from his stroll he would ask if any seafaring  men had gone by along the road. 
Ok, so this just tells us that Bill does ask about "seafaring men", but it doesn't tell us  why. Let's check the next sentence to see if it tells us what we need to know: At first we thought it was the want of company of his own kind that made him ask  this question, but at last we began to see he was desirous to avoid them. Here we go. This sentence tells us that Bill "was desirous to avoid [seafaring men]".  In other words, he wanted to stay away from them! 
Let's use that as our prediction: 
"Bill wants to stay away from sailors". 
Which choice says something similar to our prediction? 
Choice D is similar to our prediction. Choice D is the answer. </p>
